Feature Request ?
===========================
Feature requests are created when a user needs something with an open source software. In the request,
user will explain his needs, and his requirements.

Other elveos users are then invited to **contribute** on the feature request, until enough money is raised. 

A developer will then be able to **create an offer** to develop the feature.

Features states
---------------
During its life, a feature has various states: 

 * Funding, the initial state. Lasts until enough money is raised.
 * Offer validation, a short time span allowing contributors to accept or refuse an offer to develop.
 * In development, until the request is fully developed (this phase includes validation).
 * Success, when the validation happened successfully.
