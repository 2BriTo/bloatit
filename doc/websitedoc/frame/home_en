What is elveos ?
================
Elveos is a place where people that need free software and developers meet to create the free software for tomorrow.

 * If you are a developer, you can be paid for creating cool software.
 * If you are a user of open source, you can find people sharing the same need as you, and share the cost of the development among all of you.
 
Where should I start ?
======================
You want to develop or fund open-source projects, [browse](/en/feature/list) the list of feature and find one you like.

You need something implemented in open-source ? [Check](/en/feature/list) if somebody else already had the same idea. If not [ask](/en/feature/create) a developer to create it.

If you want to know more, you can read the [documentation](/en/documentation).
