API
===

For instance, there is only one extern api for elveos.org. This is a REST api and you can only read public things with it

## REST API

This is a very simplified overview of the REST api.

### List entities
All begin with the following url: [https://elveos.org/rest/](/rest/)

Then add an entity key as 'features' to list all the features: 

[https://elveos.org/rest/features](/rest/features)

noted as:

    /rest/features

### Show an entity
To see a specific entity and not all the list, you just have to add the id of the entity:

    /rest/features/12

In the result, all the item in lists are defined with their id. If a request on a feature (as /rest/features/12) returns a list of contributions as:

    <contributions>
        <contribution>132</contribution>
        <contribution>133</contribution>
        <contribution>134</contribution>
        <contribution>225</contribution>
        <contribution>226</contribution>
        <contribution>236</contribution>
    </contributions>
    
you can get details of contributions requesting the entity named "contributions" with the corresponding id :

    /rest/contributions/132
