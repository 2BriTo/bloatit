##Who are we? / finance / website (are you scammers?)

- **Who are we? We created this website?**
We are three former students of INSA Lyon, Frédéric, Thomas and Yoann. We left our respective jobs to start our own business. 

- **How does Elveos gain money?**
We take a fee on money coming into the website. The answer to the next question will tell you more.

- **There is a fee on the money I give? How much?**
Yes, we take a commission on the money that is entrusted to elveos. When you load your elveos account, you pay a commission. Then, all internal transactions on Elveos are free. 
It is also possible that you have to pay withdrawal fees. if you are in euro, transfers are free. Otherwise you'll to pay bank transaction fees.

- **Is Elveos managed by a for-profit business?**
Elveos is not managed by a non-profit organisation, but by a company (French SAS). We have obviously not intended to be a millionaire, but simply to make a living from our work, while being able to help improve free software.

- **10% + 0.30€ is expensive !**
10% + € 0.30 may seem high. However take into account that on this amount, we must pay VAT and bank transaction fees. Elveos recovers in the end ~ 7% of each transaction, allowing us to pay for lodging, miscellaneous expenses, and eventually salaries.

- **10% + € 0.30? why not just 10%?**
Because we have to pay charges on each bank transaction we prefer encouraging users to make a large payment instead of several small ones.

- **Is your site perennial?**
We are a young company and we can fail.
If this were to happen, we will do everything to try to continue to support the site... but we can't really tell you more because we have not yet considered this scenario in detail.

- **What will you do with my personal information?**
Elveos **never** distributes your personal data to a third party.
Furthermore we do everything we can to keep it as safe as possible... With us passwords or credit card numbers are never stored unencrypted.

- **Will you put advertisings on the elveos.org wbesite?**
No.
We do not like advertising on the internet, therefore we do not want to put any on our own website.

##Free software, licence

- **Under what licenses the programs are distributed? What licenses are allowed on the site?**
Softwares developed on elveos must be free. hence all free licenses recongnized by the Open Source Initiative are allowed. 

- **Do you believe in free software?**
Yes. 
Elveos website is licensed under the GNU Affero. We regularly contribute to various free software projects (eg Perroquet, exxEditor ...). We created this site in order to provide a new way of funding free software and to improve them.

##Feature requester

- **I have an idea, but it's complicated and I cannot explain itself properly**
We plan to add to the website a feature we call braintorms to address this use case. However we haven't done it yet.
In the meantime, feel free to create feature request, even incomplete, people can be improve it through the comments. We are aware that this is not the optimal process, but it's all we can offer for now.

- **Who will choose the developer?**
Contributors.
When a developer thinks he can make the development, he will make an offer on the elveos website. If the offer does not appeal to contributors (too expensive, developer doesn't have enough experience  ...) they can vote against the offer (negative vote). On the other hand, if they like the offer they can vote for this offer.

- **Who has the right to vote to choose the developer?**
Everyone who contributed on the feature request.

- **What happens if there is a difference between the developer's offer and the request?**
If you find the difference unacceptable, you can vote *against* the offer.
If you find the difference unacceptable but not enough people share your opinion, you can cancel your contribution before the development start.

- **What happens if nobody want to develop my idea?**
If you feel that the request will never succeed, you can cancel your contribution.
If you think there is a real potential in your request, but it does not take off, check that you have explained what you want correctly... and feel free to talk about the feature on forums, your blog ...

- **When is the money debited from my account?**
Once you decide to contribute.
Elveos takes money at the contribution. This ensures to the developer that money is available.

- **Who decides if the software matches my expectations?**
You.
At the end of development, the developer release its creation on the Elveos website. Then, you can test it and report the bugs.
You have 7 days minimum to report bugs. After that, if there are no more major bugs, development will be considered validated, and the developer will be paid. It will no longer be possible to report problems on Elveos. However, you can still contact the developer directly!

- **Who sets the amount needed to implement my idea?**
The developer.
A developer interested in implementing your idea can create an offer, in which he should set an amount.

- **What happens if contributors give more money than requested by the developer?**
The developer receives all the contributions, including the surplus.


##Developers

- **Can I develop proprietary software in response of a feature resquest?**
No. Only the developments made under a license recognized by the Open Source Initiative are allowed on the elveos website.

- **When will I get paid for my work? Under what conditions?**
The money will be transferred to the Elveos account of the developer at least 7 days after the first release and as soon as the last critical bug have been closed.
Then, the developer may withdraw the money from his elveos account to his bank account by making a withdrawal request.

- **I'm a developer, I like to contribute on free software, but I prefer to do it for free.**
It's a very respectable attitude! Other developers, however, are not willing/able to do so for free.
Developing using Elveos, you will receive money into an internal Elveos account. You can then use this money to contribute (without charge) on another projet, perhaps allowing a developer who cannot afford to work for free to participate too.

##Process

- **The amount requested by the developer have been reached, why didn't the development start yet ?**
We give contributors a short delay so they can ensure the offer matches their need.
This will prevent a developer making a "fake" offer with the exact amount of the sum of contributions, which would block the request.

- **There are no more bugs, but the feature request is not validated. Why?**
There is a minimum delay of 7 days after the release have been done and the development can be validated.
This delay allows users to test the release.
In addition, when the conditions are met, we manually validate the request for a final check that there are no problems.
