Ethics and openness
===================


Elveos's goal is simple: promote and develop open source software by giving it a new funding source.


For now, open source software have two major funding source:

 - Donation, which are a kind of support ofter distant from the real needs of the donors, but they have a strong collaborative spirit.
 - Support sales which are near to the customer needs, but loosing the collaborative spirit.

Elveos is between the two:
We help open source users to express their needs while keeping the collaborative aspect that characterizes free software movement.

To achieve these objectives, Elveos must be exemplary in terms of openness and transparency:

- The [elveos's source code](http://elveos.indefero.net/p/elveos/source/tree/master/) is public, under open source licence (AGPLv3), as well as working versions.
- Except for personal information, all data on the site are public, ensuring total transparency of the process.
- The community is part of Elveos, and is invited to participate as much as possible on the site, through moderation, reviews and soon, translations.
- For more transparency, Linkeos will publish as much information about its functioning. Including its budget, revenue and expenditure.
- All the tools used for development are open source. The exceptions are the tools of our current host OVH (VMware for example) and in very rare cases, a word processing for some paperwork.
