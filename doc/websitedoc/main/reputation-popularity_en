Reputation, popularity
=================

Elveos contain a reputation and popularity system, design to note the contents created by the users.

Each user has a reputation of zero when opening its account. The more popular his contents become, the more reputation he will get. 

Each content has a popularity value. The users can vote to tell if a content seems to be useless or useful. A positive vote will make the popularity grows up, and a negative one will make the popularity goes done.
The more reputation a user have the more influence his vote will have.

A user can vote only once on each content, and he cannot vote for the elements he has created. 


The elements with a low popularity will be automatically hidden. The users with a high popularity will have some moderation rights.
