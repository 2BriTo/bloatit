Fred is our front-end developer. He is the only person of the team able to do CSS. He created almost all the design of Elveos, including the resources (such as our lovely elveos gal & guy).

Elveos : [fred](/m/yoann)

Nobody really knows what Yoann does. He takes care of some of the administrative stuff, does some programming (but not that much) redacts some documents. Mostly however he criticizes the UI, maybe hoping to lead Elveos to perfection.
