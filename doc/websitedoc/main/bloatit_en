Bloatit, Elveos's engine
===========================

The elveos.org website uses a Java framework nammed Bloatit.

This framework has been developed specifically for the occasion and uses FCGI or SCGI to contact a web server. Bloatit was thought to be usable with another site and even if the framework is not yet dissociated in source code from elveos.

Dependancies
-----------

Elveos has some depedencies :

 - Hibernate for  the connexions to the database
 - Liquibase for database migration.
 - Log4j for logs
 - and few other small dependancies ...

Language choose
----------------

Initially, the development of bloatit started in Python. However, the difficulty of refactoring and renaming quickly brought us to rewrite the program in a statically typed language, allowing much greater control of consistency as Java.
