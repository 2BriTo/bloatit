Bloatit, Elveos's engine
===========================

The elveos.org website uses a Java framework nammed Bloatit.

This framework has been developed especially for the elveos website and uses FCGI or SCGI to communicate with a web server. Bloatit was thought to be usable with another site and even if the framework is not yet dissociated in source code from elveos.

Language choose
----------------

Initially, the development of bloatit started in Python. However, the difficulty of refactoring and fast renaming brought us to rewrite the program in a statically typed language, allowing much greater control of consistency as Java.
