System architecture
===================

Elveos.org website run on only one server.

Bloatit framework
-----------------

It's the application core. Bloatit is developed in Java. Unlike the usual Java websites, Bloat does not need application server and does not use servlet. It uses a "classical" web server with [FCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html).

More informations on this site engine are available on this documentation page : [Bloatit, engine of elveos](/en/documentation/bloatit))


Database server
---------------

We uses posgresql and hibernate for the data storage. 

Web server
---------
Bloatit currently uses  Lighttpd as web server. The choice of this server has no real justification except that it is known to be good. By digging, we could say that this is a revenge against Apache, because it has a relationship with Maven and maven is evil! We will soon begin experiments with Ngix.

The use of FCGI make that we can easily change the web server.

Operating system
----------------

The site runs on a Debian Squeeze. This choice is mainly justified by our own skills.

Host
----

We chose OVH as host, because they are based in France and have always been effective for previous services.


We choose the VPS ([http://www.ovh.com/fr/vps/](http://www.ovh.com/fr/vps/)) solution.

Currently, the theorical characteristics are:

- CPU : 2.5 GHz - 4 core
- RAM : 3 Go
- Storage : 50 Go	
- Sla :  99.9% (9h of downtime for a year)
- Price : 50â‚¬/month
