Teams
===========

Members of elveos can be grouped into teams. A member can belong to as many teams as he wish.

A team may represent an foundation, a company or any group of people. A team has an internal account (allowing it to pay and to be paid), and can contribute to feature request or receive money.

There are two different kind of teams: public teams and private teams. Anyone can join a public team, but you have to be invited to join a private team.

Rights
----------

The team members may have separate roles. The team creator is the team administrator, and he can give (or remove) the rights of other members.

Here are the rights that you may have when you're in a team:

- Consult: right to see information about this team
- Talk: right to speak on the behalf of the team
- Invite: right to invite new members into the team
- Edit: right to change team information
- Promote: right to give (or remove) rights to other team members
- Banking: the right to access, to change this team bank information (including withdraw money, or make contributions)

Act on behalf of a team
------------------------

In elveos many actions can be made on the behalf of a team.

For example: 

- A developer may make an offer on the behalf of an foundation. In this case, it is not the developer who gets the money, but the foundation.
- A user can write a comment on the  behalf of his company, thereby he act as  ahis company spokesman.
- Almost all actions are feasible in the name of a team.
